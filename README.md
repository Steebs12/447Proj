Top Rank Tank is an arcade-inspired web game where players control a tank in an attempt to take down all other tanks around them. Players will fight through 4 levels attempting to complete each level with as many lives remaining as possible in order to earn 3 stars across each level!

In addition to classic levels, players can also play an endless Arcade mode where they'll see how long they can last against infinitely spawning enemies and how many points they can rack up.

### How to play:
Players move using the **W-A-S-D** keys on their keyboard, and use their mouse to aim the cursor in the direction they want to shoot. **Left Clicking** the mouse will shoot, and **Q** will unlock the mouse from the screen.

Destroying all of the tanks in a level will complete a level for the player and allow them to return to the level-select screen, where they unlock access to the next level. Players will earn stars based on how many lives they have remaining when they win:
- 3 lives left = 3 stars
- 2 lives left = 2 stars
- 1 life left = 1 star

In Arcade mode players will earn score instead, earning 10 points every time an enemy tank is destroyed. New enemy tanks will spawn in a random loaction every time a previous enemy is destroyed, so be careful where you drive!

An account is required to save your progress within the game as well as your highest scores on each level and in arcade mode.
